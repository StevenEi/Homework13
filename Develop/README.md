# Homework 12 - E-commerce Back End

## Project Description 
This project was meant to help me learn how to write different routes and models given starter code and seeds. This assignment
felt more difficult than I believe it was meant to be because I was having issues with Insomnia (it consistently didn't read
the req.body information from my put requests for some reason). Despite that, it was good practice getting used to writing the
different requests and models and knowing what information should be contained within them.

## Installation Information
Install the npm registry using "npm install" in the console and then install any desired packages by typing "[package name] install". This project utilizes dotenv, express, mysql2 and sequelize packages.

No additional installation information is necessary.

## Usage 
This whole program is meant to to represent the back-end of a functioning e-commerce website. With the addition of some
handlebars files and other front end files this could be a fully functioning project. Currently though, the results of it's
functionality is displayed only in Insomnia and MySQL's workbench.
